This project compares whether two images are EXACTLY the same, disconsidering ONLY CHANGES THAT MAY HAVE HAPPENNED THROUGH SCALING. This may be useful for searchs of images at the web, in which we don't want to present the exact same image twice, but since they have been scaled their hash wouldn't match. 

Many other existing algorithms are far better than the one implemented here and can solve more difficult problems. This was NOT done as a computer vision project.
